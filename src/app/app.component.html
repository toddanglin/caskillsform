    <p>For the next two questions, focus on technology topics where you have active practical experience. For this data to be useful, we do not need to 
      capture every technology topic you've heard of or used once in the past. Think about the technology topics you are capable of covering as a Cloud Advocate today.</p>
    <h3 class="title is-4">Primary Technical Focus Areas</h3>
    <p>Select your <b>primary</b> technical focus areas. These should be technical topics where you have a 300 or 400 level of
      experience and comfort. Your knowledge and experience are current. These should be topics that you are "known for" as an Advocate.
